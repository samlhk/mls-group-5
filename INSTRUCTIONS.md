## Last Update
- **[07/03/2025]** We have released task 2. Please check the live recording of today's lecture for details. (The slides will be uploaded later)
- **[11/02/2025]** Update instructions of pytorch demo. If you encounter a `No disk space` error, try logging into Interactive mode first and installing the environment on the node.
- **[05/02/2025]** We have uploaded the code template for the first part of the assessment into the `task-1` folder. Additionally, we have relocated the `pytorch-demo` to the `resources` directory and have included materials for `gpu-programming` in the same directory. The part 1 specification in under the `Assessment` section on Learn.

## Course Tasks

### Task 1: Triton/Cupy Operator
- Implement an ML operator using Triton/Cupy.
- Learn about performance optimization and profiling.

### Task 2: Integration into Distributed System
- Deploy an end-to-end RAG serving system.
- Measure the system performance.
- Optimize the deployment with a request queue and batcher.

### Paper Writing
- Write a paper documenting your work on both tasks in the format of a NeurIPS or ICML paper.
