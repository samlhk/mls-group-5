## Repository Structure

- [**Task-1**](./task-1): Part 1, Implementing machine learning operators with GPU programming.
- [**Task-2**](./task-2): Part 2, Integrating the operator into a distributed ML system (ServerlessLLM + RAG).
- [**Resources**](./resources): Slides and reading materials related to the course.

## Last Update
- **[11/02/2025]** Update instructions of pytorch demo. If you encounter a `No disk space` error, try logging into Interactive mode first and installing the environment on the node.
- **[05/02/2025]** We have uploaded the code template for the first part of the assessment into the `task-1` folder. Additionally, we have relocated the `pytorch-demo` to the `resources` directory and have included materials for `gpu-programming` in the same directory. The part 1 specification in under the `Assessment` section on Learn.

## Course Tasks

### Task 1: Triton/Cupy Operator
- Implement an ML operator using Triton/Cupy.
- Learn about performance optimization and profiling.

### Task 2: Integration into Distributed System
- Integrate your Task 1 operator into a distributed ML system using ServerlessLLM and RAG.

### Paper Writing
- Write a paper documenting your work on both tasks in the format of a NeurIPS or ICML paper.

## Course Schedule

The course consists of 10 weeks of lectures and Q&A sessions. Each week has the following structure:
- **Lectures**: Core topics presented by the primary and guest lecturers.
- **Q&A Sessions**: Focused on solving problems, demos, and discussing task-related questions.
